# Elegy-The-Beasts-of-War

## Design Pillars
###Tactical
Elegy: The Beasts of War, as a tactical-RPG stresses the importance of strategy. As a game that strives to be difficult, a playerâ€™s tactics will need to be sharp to engage with the gameplay. Battles should take thought and feel fulfilling to the player.

###Freedom
Players should not be prohibited in their character choices, besides the bounds of the contents itself. When it comes to dialogue, character relationships, narrative choices, and even more mechanical things such as class selection and level ups, Players should have complete freedom.

###Consequential
The brutality of war should be mimicked in its consequential systems. During battle, each move should have a consequence, whether good or bad. Dialogue and narrative choices should have their own consequences as well, whether good or bad.
