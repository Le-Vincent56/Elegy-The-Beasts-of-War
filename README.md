# Elegy-The-Beasts-of-War
_ _Elegy: The Beasts of War_ _ is a topdown, tactical RPG inspired by games like _ _Fire Emblem: Awakening_ _ and _ _Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga_ _. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, and a difficulty curve meant for more extreme tactical players, _ _Elegy: The Beasts of War_ _ uses the guise of dark fantasy to attempt to make sense of the villainy of war and its many, **many** consequences. Customize the classes of your unlikely team, battle your way through fantastical skirmishes, and make the difficult choices only a great leader could make. The songs only cease for the dead.

## Design Pillars
### Tactical
Elegy: The Beasts of War, as a tactical-RPG stresses the importance of strategy. As a game that strives to be difficult, a playerâ€™s tactics will need to be sharp to engage with the gameplay. Battles should take thought and feel fulfilling to the player.

### Freedom
Players should not be prohibited in their character choices, besides the bounds of the contents itself. When it comes to dialogue, character relationships, narrative choices, and even more mechanical things such as class selection and level ups, Players should have complete freedom.

### Consequential
The brutality of war should be mimicked in its consequential systems. During battle, each move should have a consequence, whether good or bad. Dialogue and narrative choices should have their own consequences as well, whether good or bad.
